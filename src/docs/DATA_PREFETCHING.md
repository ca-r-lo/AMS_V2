# Data Prefetching Documentation

## Overview
The application implements a data prefetching system that loads all necessary data immediately after establishing a successful server connection. This approach ensures that users have immediate access to data when navigating through different sections of the application.

## Implementation Details

### Connection Flow
1. Server health check
2. Data prefetching for all major sections
3. Navigation to login page

### Prefetched Data
The following data is prefetched automatically:
- Dashboard statistics and activity
- Sections list
- Students data
- Reports data
- Statistics data

### Error Handling
- Connection timeout after 10 seconds
- Separate error states for connection and prefetching
- Retry mechanism for failed attempts

## Benefits
- Improved perceived performance
- Reduced loading times during navigation
- Better offline capabilities through cached data
- Smoother user experience

## Technical Implementation
The prefetching system uses React Query's prefetchQuery functionality to:
- Cache data for immediate access
- Handle background updates
- Manage stale data
- Provide consistent loading states

## Usage
The prefetching system is automatically triggered after a successful server connection. No additional implementation is required in individual components.

## Error States
1. Connection Error: Server is unreachable
2. Prefetch Error: Server is reachable but data loading failed
3. Timeout: Server did not respond within the timeout period

## Best Practices
- Always check connection status before accessing protected routes
- Use the prefetched data through React Query hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries for failed prefetch scenarios
